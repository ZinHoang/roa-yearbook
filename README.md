# roa-yearbook

This is one of my group projects during my journey at Dev Academy. The project was also deployed to `Heroku` https://roayearbook.herokuapp.com/    

In this project, I and my groupmates created a web app that allows you to create your own profile by adding your favourite animal and your blog's link (optional). 

Clone this repo and have fun :thumbsup:

- If the generated animal gif doesn't satisfy your taste, you can edit it by submitting your animal of interest again or changing to another animal, and hopefully you will get a more entertaining one :)  

- The API we employed for our project is [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/).
